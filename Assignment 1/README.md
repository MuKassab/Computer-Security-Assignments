# Assignment #1

The code contained in solution.py contains the implementation of Shift a.k.a (Ceaser), Affine and Vigenere ciphers. <br>
Each algorithm is capable of both encrypting and decryption an input text file and produce a output text file. <br> <br>

# How to use:
The file is called from the cmd in the follwing manner
```
python solution.py CipherName enc/dec input.txt output.txt parameters
```
Examples:<br>
```
python solution.py vigenere enc in.txt out.txt AYUSH
python solution.py shift dec in.txt out.txt 5
python solution.py affine enc in.txt out.txt 21 50
```
